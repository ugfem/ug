    devices - the devices module defines an interface to machine dependent window
                and event handling
    
    PURPOSE:
    The devices module defines an interface for graphics ouput on windows and for
    the event handling. Interfaces with window and event handling are defined for
    XWindows ('xif') and Macintosh ('mif') computers up to now but should be easily extendable to
    other platforms like Microsoft Windows or others.
    
    The possibility of a very simple text interface is also offered ('sif'). With this
    interface ug should run on hardly any machine and also in batch mode.
    
    Additionally there exists the possibility to write graphical ouput in form of 
    a special ug-defined graphics commands format called 'metafile' to file which
    later can be viewed using the
    program 'xugv' or converting it to PostScript using the 'm2ps' tool.
    
    The machine interface is split into two parts':'

.n      a) output to the shell
.n      b) event handling (including input from shell), window management and graphics
    
    The first is defined via the interface functions

.n      UserWrite
.n      UserWriteF
.n      PrintErrorMessage
.n      WriteString

    while the input from shell is connected with the event handling (--> 'EVENT'). (machines
    without event handling can nevertheless define a standard interface which only returns events
    of type 'TERM_STRING_EVENT'.) For details see also 'ProcessEvent'.
    
    For the event handling c.f. 'ProcessEvent' and the description of the 'EVENT' data structure.
    
    The graphics interface is defined by a data structure called --> 'OUTPUTDEVICE' and
    can be either the monitor screen using the machines window management
    or a file to which graphics commands are written. This struct requires basic plotting
    functions, color palette handling and functions for window handling.
    
    STRUCTURE:
    The devices module consists of a file 'ugdevices.c' providing some interface functions
    for':'
    
.n      - enroling output devices at initialization time
.n      - output on the shell window
.n      - printing of error messages
.n      - log file mechanism (shell output can be protocoled)
.n      - defining a mutelevel which controls how verbose output of functions is
.n      - opening the shell window at initialization time
    
    Then there are some subdirectories that contain different output devices for
    graphics output':'
    
.n      xif - here is the source code for the XWindows interface
.n      mif - here is the source code for the Macintosh interface
.n      meta - here is the source code for the (machine independent) metafile interface

    STRUCT COMPONENTS:
    We only explain the function pointers together with their arguments and types in correct order.
    
.   Move            - move the current cursor position: 'SHORT_POINT position'
.   Draw            - draw a line with the current color and the current line width
                        from the current cursor position to: 'SHORT_POINT endposition'.
.   Polyline        - draw a polygonal line (not closed) connecting 'SHORT_POINT points[], INT nPoints' in total
.   InversePolyline - draw an inverse polygonal line (not closed) connecting 'SHORT_POINT points[], INT nPoints' in total
.   Polygon         - draw a filled polygon (closed) connecting 'SHORT_POINT points[], INT nPoints' in total
.   InversePolygon  - draw an inverse filled polygon (closed) connecting 'SHORT_POINT points[], INT nPoints' in total
.   ErasePolygon    - erase filled polygon (closed) connecting 'SHORT_POINT points[], INT nPoints' in total
.   Polymark        - plot 'short nMarkers' at 'SHORT_POINT points[]'
.   Text            - write text at 'SHORT_POINT position' with 'INT mode' TEXT_REGULAR or TEXT_INVERSE
.   CenteredText    - write centered text at 'SHORT_POINT position' with 'INT mode' TEXT_REGULAR or TEXT_INVERSE
.   ClearViewPort   - clear the whole view port of the window
.   SetLineWidth    - set current line width to 'short width'
.   SetTextSize     - set current text size to 'short size'
.   SetMarker       - set current marker id to 'short id'
.   SetMarkerSize   - set current marker size to 'short size'
.   SetColor        - set current color to 'short color'
.   SetPaletteEntry - set palette entry 'long entry' to ('short red', 'short green', 'short blue')
.   SetNewPalette   - init palette entries in the range 'long start' to 'long end' with colors
                        ('short red[]', 'short green[]', 'short blue[]')
.   GetPaletteEntry - return current rgb values of entry 'long entry' in 'short *red', 'short *green', 'short *blue'
.   Flush           - flush the graphics buffer (iff)

.   OpenOutput      - open a window with 'char title[]', lower left corner at ('INT x, INT y') with
                        'INT width' and 'INT heigth'. The global coordinates (in the screen) and the local
                        coordinates (in the window) of the view port (lower left and upper right corner)
                        are stored in 'INT Global_LL[2]' etc. The return values is the window id.
.   CloseOutput     - close the window with 'WINDOWID id'
.   ActivateOutput  - activate the window with 'WINDOWID id'
.   UpdateOutput    - update the window with 'WINDOWID id', write string 'char *s' into the info
                        box and display 'INT tool' as current tool
    
    The remaining struct components are suppose to be self explanatory.
