/** \struct domain

The DOMAIN structure describes a two- or three-dimensional domain. This geometry
information is used by UG when it refines a grid, i.e. complex geometries are approximated
better when the grid is refined. The DOMAIN structure is a directory in the
environment tree (see ENVIRONMENT in the ug/low section). 

A domain is made up of one or several `boundary segments` which are defined by the
BOUNDARY_SEGMENT (see that page) structure. 
The BOUNDARY_SEGMENT objects are stored in the environment
tree in the corresponding DOMAIN. The points where boundary segments join are
called corners of the domain. For each corner a NODE is automatically created.

Domains are created with the function CreateDomain.

. d - Makes the DOMAIN an environment directory. d stores also the name of
the domain.

. MidPoint,radius -  Defines a ball which should contain the domain. This information
is used in the graphics module to initialize the view with a reasonable transformation.

. numOfSegments -  Gives the number of BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structures that
will define the domain. 

. numOfCorners - Number of corners defined by the domain.

. domConvex - True, if the domain is convex.

MACROS:

The components of the DOMAIN structure are only read internally. The
user only creates domains with the function CreateDomain. Therefore
no access macros are provided.

EXAMPLES:

The following code fragment shows the definition of a simple two-dimensional
domain. The domain is the unit circle defined by two boundary segments, the
upper half circle and the lower half circle. Therefore the domain has two
corners, two boundary segments and one subdomain (the domain itself).

The following two functions of type BndSegFuncPtr define the
mapping for the upper and lower half circle respectively.

\verbatim
// circleBoundary maps [0.0,1.0] to the upper half circle
static INT circleBoundaryUpper (void *data, DOUBLE *param, DOUBLE *result)
{
    DOUBLE lambda;

    // retrieve parameter value 
    lambda = param[0];

    // check range
    if ((lambda<0.0)||(lambda>1.0)) return(1);

    // fill result 
    result[0] = cos(PI*lambda); // x  PI defined in misc.h 
    result[1] = sin(PI*lambda); // y 

    // return ok 
    return(0);
}

// circleBoundary maps [0.0,1.0] to the lower half circle
static INT circleBoundaryLower (void *data, DOUBLE *param, DOUBLE *result)
{
    DOUBLE lambda;

    // retrieve parameter value 
    lambda = param[0];

    // check range 
    if ((lambda<0.0)||(lambda>1.0)) return(1);

    // fill result 
    result[0] = cos(PI+PI*lambda); // x  PI defined in misc.h 
    result[1] = sin(PI+PI*lambda); // y 

    // return ok 
    return(0);
}
\endverbatim

The following function InitUnitCircle uses the functions
CreateDomain and CreateBoundarySegment2D in order to create
a domain and the list of boundary segments for that domain.

\verbatim
static INT InitUnitCircle (void)
{
    DOUBLE radius,MidPoint[2];

    MidPoint[0] = MidPoint[1] = 0.0;
    radius = 1.05;
    if (CreateDomain(
            "circle",               // name of the new domain

       )==NULL) return(1);

    // allocate the boundary segments, segment allocation must              
    // immediately follow the domain definition.                            
    if (CreateBoundarySegment2D(
            "circle bnd upper",     // name of the boundary segment

/*! \struct boundary_segment
 \brief Data structure defining part of the boundary of a domain

STRUCTURES:

\verbatim
typedef INT (*BndSegFuncPtr) (void *,DOUBLE *,DOUBLE *);

typedef struct boundary_segment BOUNDARY_SEGMENT;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

A domain for UG is described as a set of boundary segments defined
by the BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure. Each boundary segment is a mapping
from `d`-1 dimensional parameter space to `d` dimensional eucledian space.
The parameter space is an interval [a,b] in two dimensions or a rectangle
[a,b]x[c,d] in three dimensional applications.

`2D boundary segments`
\verbatim
      0        1
      +--------+     maps [a,b] to R x R
      a        b
\endverbatim

`3D boundary segments`
\verbatim
    d +--------+     maps [a,b]x[c,d] to R x R x R
      |3      2|
      |        |
      |        |
      |0      1|
    c +--------+
      a        b
\endverbatim


For all boundary segments the points in `d` dimensional space corresponding to the parameters
a and b in two dimensions ((a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,d) in three dimensions)
are called `corners` of the domain. Locally for each boundary segment the
corners are numbered like shown in the figures above.
The corners are numbered `globally` in a consecutive way beginning with 0.
`CAUTION:` boundary segments must be defined in such a way that no two
corners are identical!

In two dimensions `internal boundary
segments` can be defined in order to divide the domain into `subdomains`
having different materials for example. The subdomains are numbered consecutively
beginning with 1. By default the exterior of the domain has number 0.

Boundary segments are created with the function CreateBoundarySegment2D
and CreateBoundarySegment.

. v - The BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure is an environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT),
therefore it has the ENVVAR v as its first component. v stores also the
name of the boundary segment.

. left,right - Numbers of left and right subdomain. The right subdomain is where the
normal vector of the curve points to in a right handed coordinate system. The TeX
version of this page contains two figures for clarification. 
In 2D it is simple: Walk along the curve in direction of increasing parameter
values and look to the right. There is the right subdomain. In 3D the rule
is as follows. Let the thumb point in direction of increasing values
of the first parameter, let the index finger point in direction of
increasing values of the second parameter, then the middle finger
points to the right subdomain.  

. id - Number of the boundary segment beginning with zero.

. segType - Type of boundary segment. Currently only NON_PERIODIC is
allowed. Later periodic boundary segments will be implemented.

. points - Mapping of local numbers of corners to global numbers. Remember, all
global numbers of corners must be different. The local numbering scheme can
be seen from the figures above.

. resolution - Parameter indicating the curvature of the boundary segment. This is
used mainly by the graphics module in order plot a boundary segment. For
straight lines 1 is sufficient.

. alpha,beta - Defines the parameter space. In 2D this is the interval
[alpha[0],beta[0]], in 3D this is the rectangle 
[alpha[0],beta[0]] x [alpha[1],beta[1]] (or a=alpha[0], b=beta[0],
c=alpha[1], d=beta[1] in the figure above.

. BndSegFunc - Pointer to a C function describing the mapping from parameter
space to the `d`-space. This function must be of type BndSegFuncPtr.
(see below).

. data - User defined pointer. This pointer is passed as the first
argument to the BndSegFunc of the segment. This pointer can be used
to construct an interface to geometry data files, e.g. from a CAD system.

. BndSegFuncPtr - Data type of the functions mapping parameter space to
`d`-space. The first argument of type void * is the user data pointer from
the corresponding BOUNDARY_SEGMENT. The second parameter of type DOUBLE *
provides an array containing the parameters where the boundary segment
function should be evaluated (one number in 2D, two numbers in 3D). The
third parameter of type DOUBLE * provides an array where the result can be placed
(x,y values in 2D, x,y,z values in 3D).

MACROS:

The components of the BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure are accessed through
the BNDSEGDESC structure, see that man page.

STRUCTURES:

\verbatim
typedef INT (*CoeffProcPtr) (DOUBLE *, DOUBLE *);
typedef INT (*UserProcPtr) (DOUBLE *, DOUBLE *);
typedef INT (*ConfigProcPtr) (INT argc, char **argv);


typedef struct problem PROBLEM ;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The PROBLEM data type is used to give a complete description
of the pde to be solved. Since this is a UG data type and UG is
independent of the pde to be solved it must be a very general mechanism.
The abstraction is that a problem is completely described by
(1) The domain, (2) the pde, (3) coefficient functions for the pde
and (4) boundary conditions. The first two items are handled easily.
When creating a PROBLEM then the name of a DOMAIN has to be passed
as a parameter (see example below). The pde to be solved is determined
by the problem class library that is linked to the UG library. In order
to be sure that a problem description and the problem class library
are intended for the same pde, each problem class library exports
in identification number that has to coincide with the
number given in the problem description. Problems are created by
the function CreateProblem.

. CoeffProcPtr - This function gets a DOUBLE and a DOUBLE array, which are usually
called in and out. These functions are only called by the problem class
libraries, therefore the length of these arrays and the use of their entries
is not determined by UG. UG only stores pointers to these user definable functions!

. UserProcPtr - Same as a CoeffProcPtr but both arrays are of type DOUBLE *.

. ConfigProcPtr - Problem configuration function which is called be the UG command
reinit. Parameters argc, argv are those passed to the function implementing
the reinit command. This function can be used to change a parameter in the
problem description from the shell. E.g. the Reynolds number is a parameter in a
Navier-Stokes calculation. One could write a configuration functions that reads
the Reynolds number from the command line of the reinit command or from
a UG shell variable.


MACROS:

\verbatim
INT PROBLEMID (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Extracts the problem identification number from a problem.

\verbatim
ConfigProcPtr CONFIGFUNC (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the configuration function of the problem.

\verbatim
INT NUMCOEFF (PROBLEM *p); 
\endverbatim
Returns the number of coefficient functions defined in the problem description.

\verbatim
INT NUMUSERFCT (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the number of user functions in the problem description.

\verbatim
CoeffProcPtr COEFFFUNC (PROBLEM *p,INT i); 
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the i-th coefficient function of the problem.
The meaning of coefficient function i is determined by the problem class
library.

\verbatim
UserProcPtr USERFUNC (PROBLEM *p,INT i);
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the i-th user function of the problem.
The meaning of user function i is determined by the problem class
library.

DESCRIPTION:

The data type BOUNDARY_CONDITION is used to specify boundary
conditions. This is done in the same way as a domain is defined.
For each boundary segment there must be a corresponding boundary
condition function that specifies the boundary conditions along that
segment. The same parametrization is used for the boundary segment function
and the boundary condition function. The BOUNDARY_CONDITION data structure
stores a pointer to that function and some additional information.

Boundary conditions are created with the function CreateBoundaryCondition.

. v - A BOUNDARY_CONDITION is an environment variable which is stored
in the directory given by the corresponding PROBLEM object. v stores
also the name of the boundary condition.

. id - Number of the corresponding boundary segment. Boundary segments
and boundary conditions with the same id are accessible via a BNDSEGDESC
structure.

. BndCond - Pointer to a function of type BndCondProcPtr defining the
boundary condition for a segment.

. data - user definable pointer that is passed as first argument to BndCond
when it is called.

/*! \struct format

 * \brief Data type that describes parameters of the UG data structure

The FORMAT data type is used to describe parameters of the UG data structure.
Several different formats can be defined at initialization time or later. Which format
is used for a MULTIGRID can be specified when it is created or loaded from
file. Each problem class defines at least one format. FORMAT objects
are created with the CreateFormat() function.

. d - The format is an environment directory. This directory will contain a list
of SYMBOL objects. d also stores the name of the format.

. sVertex - Size of user data space in each VERTEX in bytes.

. sMultiGrid - Size of user data space in the MULTIGRID structure in bytes.

. VectorSizes - Array giving the number of DOUBLE values to be allocated
for the VECTOR per geometrical object. The number of DOUBLEs can be different
in nodes, edges, sides and elements. VectorSizes[NODEVECTOR] specifies
the number of DOUBLEs in a node of the grid. EDGEVECTOR, SIDEVECTOR
and ELEMVECTOR are used for the other geometric objects. If a number of DOUBLEs
is requested in a vector of a geometric object that is not allowed
to have degrees of freedom (determined by ug.conf file during
compilation - see makefiles) an error is returned by the CreateFormat function.

. MatrixSizes - Array determining the number of DOUBLE values in a MATRIX 
coupling of one VECTOR with another. Since the number of degrees
of freedom in a VECTOR depends on the geometrical object its is associated with -
in other words the VTYPE - the MATRIX
size depends on the type of source and destination VECTOR. The memory requirements
are assumed to be symmetric, that is a MATRIX from a node vector to an edge
vector needs the same memory as that from an edge vector to a node vector.
Therefore in 2D there are 3 vector types and 6 different matrix sizes and
in 3D there are 4 vector types and 10 different matrix sizes.
A mapping of  source and destination vector type to an index in the MatrixSizes
array is provided by the array MatrixType exported by algebra.h.
E. g. MatrixType[NODEVECTOR][EDGEVECTOR] provides the index for node-edge
matrices.

. ConnectionDepth - Consider an element `e` of a mesh (in 2D or 3D). All neighbors of that
element are said to have distance 1 from `e` and these elements form a set called E(`e`,1).
All elements having distance 1 from any element in E(`e`,1) form the set E(`e`,2). Consequently
the set containing only the element `e` is called E(`e`,0). Therefore it makes sense
to call E(`e`,d) the `set of elements having distance d from e`.
UG generates the MATRIX objects automatically from the mesh by coupling all
degrees of freedom in `e` with those of all elements up to distance `d` from `e`.
The distance `d` depends again on the position of source and destination vector as
in the MatrixSize component.

. MaxConnectionDepth,NeighborhoodDepth - These numbers are computed internally
and need not be specified nor are they useful from outside.

. PrintVertex, PrintGrid, PrintMultigrid - Pointers to functions of type
ConversionProcPtr. These functions can be specified by the user in order to
print the contents of the user data fields in vertices, grids and multigrids.

. PrintVector - is used to print user data in vectors. There may be different
print functions for each vector position.

. PrintMatrix -  is used to print user data in matrices. There may be different
print functions according to the type of source and destination vector.
There may be different
print functions according to the type of source and destination vector but on and the same
print function is used for both a->b and b->a.

. ConversionProcPtr - Data type for the print functions. First parameter
is a pointer to the user data space (this must be casted appropriately).
Second parameter is a character string containing a number of
spaces that can be used to indent the user output if it is to contain several
lines. The third parameter is a character array where the output should be placed.

MACROS:

The fields of this data structure are accessed only internally. The user
creates these data structures at initialization time with the function
CreateFormat.

EXAMPLES:

The following example defines a format where degrees of freedom are in the
nodes of the mesh and and all nodes within on element are coupled.
This format is suitable for standard conforming (bi-)linear basis
functions.

First we define DOUBLE arrays with four and two entries which
will be allocated in each NODE and MATRIX respectively, i.e.
we can represent four finite element functions and we store
two global stiffness matrices.

\verbatim
// define data types in order to determine size in bytes
typedef DOUBLE FullScalarNodeData[4];
typedef DOUBLE FullScalarLinkData[2];
\endverbatim

The following two functions of type ConversionProcPtr are used
to print the contents of a VECTOR and a MATRIX on the screen.

\verbatim
// the print functions
static INT PrintFullScalarNodeData (void *data, const char *indent, char *s)
{
    DOUBLE *vector;
   
    vector = (DOUBLE *) data;
    sprintf(s,"  x=%11.4E   b=%11.4E   v=%11.4E  t=%11.4E",
              (double)vector[0],(double)vector[1],(double)vector[2],(double)vector[3]);
    return(0);
}

static INT PrintFullScalarLinkData (void *data, const char *indent, char *s)
{
    DOUBLE *vector;

    vector = (DOUBLE *) data;
    sprintf(s,"  A=%11.4E  LU=%11.4E",(double)vector[0],(double)vector[1]);
    return(0);
}
\endverbatim

Fortunately creating a format is simplified by the two data structures
VectorDescriptor and MatrixDescriptor which are explained in the page
for CreateFormat.  The following function InitFullScalarFormat now
creates a FORMAT object in UGs environment.

\verbatim
// now enrol the format description in ug
INT InitFullScalarFormat (void)
{
    FORMAT *newFormat;
    VectorDescriptor vd[MAXVECTORS];
    MatrixDescriptor md[MAXMATRICES];
    SHORT nComp[2], Comp[1];

    // we need dofs only in nodes 
    vd[0].pos   = NODEVECTOR;
    vd[0].size  = sizeof(FullScalarNodeData);
    vd[0].print = PrintFullScalarNodeData;

    // and the following connection: node-node
    md[0].from  = NODEVECTOR;
    md[0].to    = NODEVECTOR;
    md[0].size  = sizeof(FullScalarLinkData);
    md[0].depth = 0; // only within one element !
    md[0].print = PrintFullScalarLinkData;

    // create format full scalar 
    newFormat = CreateFormat("full scalar", // name of the format
                   0,0,                     // no user data in vertex and multigrid

\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The VERTEX structure stores the level independent information of
a NODE. If several NODEs on different levels of the MULTIGRID structure
are at the same position then they share a common VERTEX object.
The VERTEX is a union of inner vertex ivertex and boundary vertex bvertex.
The bvertex has all of the ivertex plus some extra information where
the vertex is on the boundary of the domain. In the code one always works with
pointers of type VERTEX * and accesses the components through the macros described
below.

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes (see section below).

. id - Each vertex is given a unique identification number at creation.

. x - Vector with `global` coordinates.

. xi - Vector with `local` coordinates. This is used to represent the multigrid
hierarchy. The father component points to an ELEMENT of the next coarser
grid level and xi gives the position of the VERTEX within this element in
the local coordinate system of the ELEMENT. In this way also loosely coupled
grids can be represented although the grid refinement algorithm is currently
not able to produce such grids. The solvers however would work
also on much more general multigrid hierarchies.

. pred,succ - Pointers realizing a double linked list of VERTEX objects per level.
The beginning of this list is in the GRID structure.

. data - pointer to a data space of user definable size. The size is defined in
the FORMAT definition.

. father - Pointer to an ELEMENT of the next coarser level. This component is
used for multigrid interpolation and restriction (see also xi component above).
For the vertices in the coarsest grid (level 0) this pointer is NULL.

. topnode - If several NODES share this VERTEX then this pointer refers
to the NODE on the highest level. This pointer will probably `not` be supported
in the next version, its use is not recommended!

MACROS:

\verbatim
INT ID (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns VERTEX id.

\verbatim
VERTEX *PREDV (VERTEX *p);
VERTEX *SUCCV (VERTEX *p);

in both directions.

\verbatim
DOUBLE *CVECT (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE XC (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE YC (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE ZC (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
CVECT returns the array of global coordinates (i.e. a pointer) and XC, YC and
ZC return the individual components. Accessing the `z`-coordinate in a 2D application
will not lead to an error message!

\verbatim
DOUBLE *LCVECT (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE XI (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE ETA (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE NU (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
LCVECT returns the array of local coordinates with the father element and the other
macros return the individual components called XI, ETA and NU.

\verbatim
void *VDATA (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the pointer to user data space.

\verbatim
ELEMENT *VFATHER (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the pointer an ELEMENT of the next coarser grid level containing the 
given VERTEX. A NULL pointer indicates that the VERTEX is on level 0, the
coarsest level.

\verbatim
NODE *TOPNODE (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns pointer to the highest NODE using that VERTEX. The use of this
component is not recommended since it will not be supported in the future.

DESCRIPTION:

Each node of the mesh is represented by a NODE structure. When a mesh is refined
then new NODE objects are allocated on the new grid level
even at those positions where nodes were already in the coarse mesh. However, NODEs
at the same position share a common VERTEX structure.
A node provides access to all neighboring nodes via the LINK structure. There
is `no` access from a node to all the elements having the node as a corner!

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. id - Each node is assigned a unique identification number when it is created.

. index - The index indicates the position of the node in the node list. 
This component is provided mainly for compatibility reasons.

. pred,succ - All nodes of one grid level are in a double linked list.

. start - Points to the first element of the LINK list. The LINK list
provides access to all neighbors of the node.

. father,son - All nodes at the same position in the multigrid structure, i.e.
sharing a common VERTEX are connected by a double linked list providing access to
the node on the next coarser (father) and finer (son) grid levels.

. myvertex - Pointer to the VERTEX associated with the node.

. vector - Pointer to a VECTOR containing degrees of freedom associated with the node.

} ;

typedef struct link LINK;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The LINK structures form a single linked list starting in each NODE.
Two nodes are said to be neighbors if they are connected by an edge `in the mesh`.
Note that this is only the geometric neighborship, which can be different from the
algebraic neighborship derived from the non-zero structure of the global stiffness matrix.
Each LINK provides a pointer to one neighbor of the NODE where the list
starts. The neighbor relationship is symmetric, therefore if node `a` is a neighbor
of node `b` then `a` occurs in the list of `b` and vice versa. These two link structures
are then combined in an EDGE structure.

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. next - pointer to next LINK object.

. nbnode - Pointer to neighboring node.

MACROS:

\verbatim
NODE *NBNODE (LINK *p);
\endverbatim 

Returns pointer to a neighboring node that is stored in the LINK.

\verbatim
LINK *NEXT (LINK *p);

Returns pointer to next LINK in the list. As usual a NULL pointer indicates
the end of the list.

\endverbatim

Provides access to the EDGE where this given LINK is part of. 

\verbatim
LINK *REVERSE (LINK *p);
\endverbatim

Macro that provides fast access to the LINK in the reverse direction.
If the given LINK connects node `a` with node `b`, then REVERSE
provides the LINK in the list of node `b` pointing to `a`.

DESCRIPTION:

UG provides a flexible element concept, i.e. there may be different
types of elements in a mesh (currently limited to 8). All element types are derived
from the generic_element where the refs array is allocated to the
appropriate length. Data types for the currently implemented three different
elements triangle, quadrilateral and tetrahedron are provided only
for illustration and debugging purposes. Internally only the generic_element
is used. The TAG field in the control word is used to identify the
element type at run-time, therefore the limitation to eight element types.
Memory requirements are also higher for elements having at least one
side on the boundary because additional pointers to boundary information
is stored.
In 3D, degrees of freedom can be associated also with the sides of an element.
Since there is no data type to represent sides, the degrees of freedom associated
with a side of an element are accessed via the element (a side is shared by exactly
two elements, UG ensures the consistency of the pointers).

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. id - Each element has a unique id.

. flag - A lot of information requiring only a small number of bits must be stored
for each element. Therefore a second control word, the flag, has been introduced.
The flag is also used bitwise.

. property - Since control and flag were full, a third word had to be introduced that
can be used bitwise. A part of this word stores the element property, which is simple
a number per element. This number can be used to distinguish different materials
for example.

. pred,succ - All elements of a grid level are connected by a double linked list.

. n - Array of pointers to the corner NODEs of an element.

. father - Pointer to element on the next coarser grid level that created 
the given element during refinement.

. sons - Array of pointers to elements on the next finer grid level that
have been created by refining the given element. In 2D all sons
are directly accessible, in 3D only one pointer is stored and a complete
list of sons is constructed by the function GetSons.

. nb - Array of pointers to neighboring elements. There are as many neighbors
as the element has sides.

. vector - Pointer to VECTOR that is associated with the element. Whether degrees
of freedom are allowed to be associated with elements is determined at compile-time
through appropriate makefile switches.

. sidevector - Array of pointers to VECTORs associated with the sides of an element.
This option is available only in 3D. Whether VECTORs are allowed in sides is determined
through switches in the makefiles at compile-time.

MACROS:

INT SIDES_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);

Returns the number of edges of a given element. In 2D the number of sides and number
of edges of an element coincide.

\verbatim
INT CORNERS_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corners of a given element. This is also the size of the n
array.

\verbatim
INT SONS_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the maximum number of sons possible for a given element. This is the
size of the sons array in 2D. The actual number of sons depends on the refinement
rule that has been applied to the element and is given by the NSONS macro
(see CONTROL WORDS section below).

\verbatim
INT EDGES_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of edges of side i of the given element. In 2D a side has always one
edge since edges and sides coincide.

\verbatim
INT CORNERS_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corners of side i of the given element.

\verbatim
#define CORNERS_OF_EDGE 2
\endverbatim

This definition is provided only to make the description complete.

`The following macros determine the numbering scheme of an element. In each
element type the corners, edges and sides are numbered beginning with zero.
Each side again has a local numbering of its edges and corners and each edge
has a local numbering of its corners. We then need mappings of the numbering
scheme within edges and sides to the numbering scheme within the element.`

\verbatim
INT EDGE_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT e);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of edge e of side s within the element p.

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT c);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corner c of side s within the element p.

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_EDGE (ELEMENT *p,INT e,INT c);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corner c of edge e within the element p.

\verbatim
INT EDGE_WITH_CORNERS (ELEMENT *p,INT c0,INT c1);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of the edge (with respect to numbering in the element p)
that connects corners with numbers c0 and c1 (with respect to numbering in
element p).

\verbatim
INT SIDE_WITH_EDGE (ELEMENT *p,INT e,INT k);
\endverbatim

SIDE_WITH_EDGE(p,e,0) and SIDE_WITH_EDGE(p,e,1) delivers the numbers
of the two sides (with respect to numbering in p) that share edge number e
(also with respect to the element).

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_SIDE_INV (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT c);
\endverbatim

When c is the number of a corner and s is the number of a side
(both with respect to numbering in the element) then 
CORNER_OF_SIDE_INV returns the number of corner c with respect
to the numbering in side s or -1 if s does not contain corner c.

\verbatim
INT EDGES_OF_CORNER (ELEMENT *p,INT c,INT k);
\endverbatim

If c is the number of a corner with respect to numbering within
the element then EDGES_OF_CORNER(p,c,k) returns all numbers
of edges (with respect to p) that are connected to corner c.
Since this number is variable a value of -1 identifies an invalid entry.
The edges are numbered consecutively, i.e. if a -1 is encountered
larger values of k (less than EDGES_OF_ELEM(p)) will lead also to -1).

\verbatim
INT SUCCE (ELEMENT *p);
INT PREDE (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Return pointers to next and previous element of the double linked list of elements per level.

\verbatim
NODE *CORNER (ELEMENT *p,INT i);

\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the father element.

\verbatim
ELEMENT *SON (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

allowed and the function GetSons should be used instead. i should be
smaller than NSONS(p).

\verbatim
ELEMENT *NBELEM (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to neighboring element over side i. i should be less
than SIDES_OF_ELEM(p).

pointer is only available if the appropriate switches in the makefiles
have been set for element vectors.

\verbatim
VECTOR *SVECTOR (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the VECTOR associated with the side i
of element p. i must be less than SIDES_OF_ELEM(p). This

/*! \struct vector

 \brief Data type for unknowns in sparse matrix structure


The VECTOR data type is part of the sparse matrix vector data structure.
A VECTOR stores a user definable number of DOUBLE values (see FORMAT) and
is associated with a geometric object of the mesh (nodes, edges, sides and elements).
The size of the VECTOR can be specified differently for each type of
geometric object, but not (yet) for each individual VECTOR object.
Since there are four different geometric objects that can have degrees
of freedom, there are four different `vector types`. The vector type
is stored in the control word (see VTYPE macro) and can have the
following values

\verbatim
    NODEVECTOR 
    EDGEVECTOR 
    SIDEVECTOR
    ELEMVECTOR
\endverbatim

The VECTOR provides access to the rows of the sparse matrix belonging to
all degrees of freedom stored in the vector.

. control - Used bitwise (see below).

. object - Pointer to the geometric object associated with the vector.

. pred,succ - Realizes double linked list.

. index - Reflects position of the VECTOR in the double linked list.

. skip - Used bitwise to identify components of a VECTOR that have Dirichlet boundary 
conditions. These components have to be treated differently in some parts of the solver.

. start - Points to first element of the MATRIX list of a VECTOR. This
list represents the rows of the matrix belonging to degrees of freedom in
the given VECTOR.

. block_descr - Describes the position of this vector in the hierarchy of
BLOCKVECTORs. Only used for BLOCKVECTOR mechanism.
	
. value - Array of double values. This array is allocated dynamically with the
size specified in the FORMAT structure.

MACROS:

a macro it can also be used for assigning a value to the skip word, e.g.
VECSKIP(v)=0 will reset all bits in the skip word. VECSKIPBIT returns true
if the n th bit of the skip word is set. SETVECSKIPBIT sets the nth
bit of the skip word to 1.

MATRIX in the list is the diagonal matrix block coupling degrees
of freedom in v with itself.

/*! \struct matrix
 \brief Data type realizing sparse matrix structure

The MATRIX data type is part of UGs sparse matrix vector data structure.
A MATRIX stores all the matrix entries coupling two VECTORs (which can be identical - this
is the case for diagonal entries).
The number of entries in a MATRIX depends on the geometrical position
of the source and destination VECTOR, i.e. a MATRIX coupling
a VECTOR in NODE with a VECTOR in another NODE can have a different
size than a MATRIX coupling a VECTOR in a NODE with a
VECTOR in an EDGE.
The MATRIX structure forms a single linked list that contains all
couplings of the VECTOR where the list starts (see the VSTART macro
there). The list `always` starts with the diagonal element.
Except for diagonal MATRIX entries two MATRIX objects are combined to
build a CONNECTION object.

MACROS:

\verbatim
MATRIX *MINC (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Adds sizeof(MATRIX) to m (of course the dynamic size of m).

\verbatim
MATRIX *MDEC (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Subtracts sizeof(MATRIX) to m (of course the dynamic size of m).

\verbatim
MATRIX *MNEXT (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns pointer to next MATRIX in the list.

\verbatim
VECTOR *MDEST (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns pointer to destination VECTOR, i.e. the column VECTOR. If m is an element
of the MATRIX list of some VECTOR `a` and MDEST(m)=`b`, then m contains
all the matrix entries of rows belonging `a` and columns belonging to `b`.
 
\verbatim
MATRIX *MADJ (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the transposed MATRIX, i.e. if m couples VECTOR
`a` with VECTOR `b`, then MADJ(m) couples `b` with `a`.

\verbatim
CONNECTION *MMYCON (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the CONNECTION where m is part of.

\verbatim
DOUBLE MVALUE (MATRIX *m,INT n);
\endverbatim

Returns the nth value of the MATRIX m. The number of entries is
defined in the FORMAT structure. MVALUE is a macro and can also
be used for assignment, i.e. MVALUE(m,n)=0.0 is a valid
statement.

\verbatim
DOUBLE *MVALUEPTR (MATRIX *m,INT n);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the nth entry of the MATRIX m.

\verbatim

/*! \struct blockvector

 \brief Data type for substructuring a VECTOR list


The BLOCKVECTOR data structure realizes a mechanism to substructure a
VECTOR list as it is part of the sparse matrix vector data structure.
A BLOCKVECTOR gives access to a sublist of the VECTOR list, i.e. all
members of a BLOCKVECTOR must be placed consecutively in the VECTOR list.
A further consequence of this fact is that in most cases the VECTOR list
must be reordered such that all VECTORs forming a block are consecutive
before the BLOCKVECTOR structure can be built. But apart from reordering
the VECTOR list is not influenced by the BLOCKVECTOR structure thus all
existing functions can be used furthermore without any changes.

To represent a sequence of sublists the BLOCKVECTORs form a double
linked list that is anchored in a GRID structure. It is not necessary
(but recommended) that all VECTORs of a grid belong to a BLOCKVECTOR.

The VECTOR list represented by a BLOCKVECTOR can be substructured further.
The corresponding BLOCKVECTOR list is anchored in the parent BLOCKVECTOR.
In this way a `tree-like hierarchical data structure` is realized representing
a natural parent-child relationship. All technical terms concerning tree-like
data structures can easily be translated. 

Furthermore a blockmatrix structure is induced by the BLOCKVECTOR structure
without any additional amount of memory: 2 BLOCKVECTORs, considered as
row- and column-blockvector, determine a blockmatrix in the natural way.
Such a blockmatrix describes consequently how the column-blockvector
influences the row-blockvector. Notice: some macros for the
data structure MATRIX are not useful or have a different semantic for a 
blockmatrix; this are the macros MNEXT (provides not the next matrix element
of the blockmatrix but of the whole matrix), MADJ (the returned matrix
element belongs not necessary to the blockmatrix; it holds only if the
blockmatrix lies on the diagonal).

. control - Used bitwise (see below).

. number - Number describing the position in a BLOCKVECTOR list. Should be
unique within each list.

. pred,succ - Realizes double linked list.

. first_vec - Pointer in the VECTOR list to the first VECTOR belonging the this BLOCKVECTOR.

. end_vec - Pointer to the first VECTOR `after` the VECTOR sublist
represented by this BLOCKVECTOR. Is NULL if the BLOCKVECTOR represents
the tail of the VECTOR list.

. first_son,last_son - Start and end of blockvector list on next level

RELATED~FUNCTIONS:

. CreateBlockvector - Allocates a new BLOCKVECTOR (from the multigrids memory).

. DisposeBlockvector - Returns an unused BLOCKVECTOR to the multigrids memory.

. FreeAllBV - Disposes all BLOCKVECTORs related to one grid.

. FreeBVList - Disposes blockvector-list and all its sons.

. FindBV - Find the described blockvector in the grid.

. CreateBVStripe - Creates a stripewise domain decomposition.

. CreateBVDomainHalfening - Creates a recursive domain halfening decomposition.

. blas~routines~for~BLOCKVECTOR - ~

EXAMPLES:

Let a stripewise decomposition be given and the BLOCKVECTORs ordered
ascendend resp. their numbers. Then the following code fragments
set the IND component of the VECTORs of all BLOCKVECTORs the the
number of their BLOCKVECTOR. The result is a VECTOR list containing
in the IND component the sequence "0,0,...0,1,1,...1,2,2,...,2,3,3,..., ...".

First using the direct access to the BLOCKVECTOR list of the grid:~
\verbatim
    BLOCKVECTOR *bv;

    for ( bv = GFIRSTBV( grid ); bv != NULL; bv = BVSUCC( bv ) )
        dsetBS( bv, IND, (DOUBLE)BVNUMBER( bv ) );
\endverbatim

The second variant uses a BV_DESC instead of the pointer:~
\verbatim
    BV_DESC my_bvd;
    INT i, found;

    BVD_INIT( &my_bvd );

    for ( i = 0, found = GM_OK; found == GM_OK; i++ )
    {
        (void)BVD_PUSH_ENTRY( &my_bvd, i, &one_level_bvdf );
        found = dsetGS( grid, &my_bvd, &one_level_bvdf, IND, (DOUBLE)i );
        BVD_DISCARD_LAST_ENTRY( &my_bvd );
    }

BV_DESC - Data type for handling a sequence of blockvector numbers

STRUCTURES:
\verbatim
struct blockvector_description
{
    BVD_ENTRY_TYPE entry;    // sequence of block levels according to
                             // a certain blockvector_description_format
    BLOCKLEVEL current;      // levels 0..current-1 currently valid
    BLOCKLEVEL read;         // level read is next to be read
};

typedef struct blockvector_description BV_DESC;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

To specify a BLOCKVECTOR you can describe the "path" through the hierarchy
of BLOCKVECTORs from the root to the certain BLOCKVECTOR. Since each
BLOCKVECTOR has a unique number within the list in which it is stored
you can describe the path in terms of the blockvector number beeing traversed
during the walk. And such a sequence of blocknumbers is managed by BV_DESC.

Since each VECTOR contains a BV_DESC this data structure should be as
small as possible. To achieve this goal, the blockvector numbers are not
stored as an array of BLOCKNUMBER (which would be the simpliest way to do
the task) but they are stored bitwise: the bits of the storage entry are
broken up into packets each containing one blockvector number. The size
of all packets must be equal and is given in a BV_DESC_FORMAT structure
(see there for more information). The aim is to have packets as small as
possible but large enough to hold the largest occuring number; this gives you
the maximum possible number of packets and thus of blockvector levels you can
process.

The "packets" are stored beginning from the lowest bits. The next "packet"
in which a number can be stored is given by current. The masks necessary
to access the different "packets" are provided by a BV_DESC_FORMAT
structure. Thus each function working on a BV_DESC needs also a
BV_DESC_FORMAT. Be sure to use always the same format for a certain
BV_DESC after the first use.

. entry - Contains the pure information about the sequence of blockvector numbers.

. current - Number of levels currently stored in entry. The levels
are counted 0..current-1.

. read - Number of level next to be read. Used for a sequential reading of
the level numbers.

CONSTANTS:

\verbatim
BVD_MAX_ENTRIES = (sizeof(BVD_ENTRY_TYPE)*CHAR_BIT)
\endverbatim

Maximum number of entries in a BVD; NOTE: the actual available
number of entries depends on the range of each entry given in a
BV_DESC_FORMAT.


MACROS:

\verbatim
BLOCKLEVEL BVD_NR_ENTRIES ( BV_DESC *bvd );
\endverbatim

The number of stored BLOCKVECTOR numbers. 0 means no entry stored.

\verbatim
void BVD_INIT ( BV_DESC *bvd );
\endverbatim

Initializes a BV_DESC. Be sure to call this macro before the first use.

\verbatim
INT BVD_PUSH_ENTRY ( BV_DESC *bvd, BLOCKNUMBER bnr, BV_DESC_FORMAT *bvdf );
void BVD_DISCARD_LAST_ENTRY ( BV_DESC *bvd );
\endverbatim

Use the macro BVD_PUSH_ENTRY to add a further number to the already stored sequence
of blockvector numbers. The return value of this macro is the value of the
corresponding call to the internal function PushEntry.

The macro BVD_DISCARD_LAST_ENTRY removes the latest blockvector number from
the stored sequence.

With this 2 macros a "stack" mechanism is realized, where the
number of the root-blockvector is at the bottom of the stack and the number
for the next level is pushed at the top of stack. Note: the traditionally
"pop" corresponds to BVD_DISCARD_LAST_ENTRY but the value is thrown away
because you usually do not need the previous "pushed" value.

\verbatim
void BVD_INIT_SEQ_READ ( BV_DESC *bvd );
BLOCKNUMBER BVD_READ_NEXT_ENTRY ( BV_DESC *bvd, BV_DESC_FORMAT *bvdf );
\endverbatim

This 2 macros allow a sequential reading of the stored BLOCKNUMBERs.
BVD_INIT_SEQ_READ must be called before the first reading access. After
this each call to BVD_READ_NEXT_ENTRY returns the next BLOCKNUMBER
starting with the first stored number. You can call this macro as often
as you want; after the last stored number everytime NO_BLOCKVECTOR
is returned.

\verbatim
void BVD_SET_ENTRY ( BV_DESC *bvd, BLOCKLEVEL level, BLOCKNUMBER bnr, 
                     BV_DESC_FORMAT *bvdf );
void BVD_GET_ENTRY ( BV_DESC *bvd, BLOCKLEVEL level, BV_DESC_FORMAT *bvdf );
\endverbatim

This 2 macros give you random access to the single "packets"
(i.e. blocknumbers). The level must be within the range described in bvdf.

\verbatim
INT BVD_IS_SUB_BLOCK ( BV_DESC *bvd_a, BV_DESC *bvd_b, BV_DESC_FORMAT *bvdf );
\endverbatim

Returns true if bvd_a is a subblock of bvd_b, i.e. all the entries in
bvd_b must be same as in bvd_a.

EXAMPLES:

Let always a pointer my_bvdf to a BV_DESC_FORMAT be given.

To store a sequence of numbers use:~
\verbatim
    BV_DESC my_bvd;
    INT error = GM_OK;

    BVD_INIT( &my_bvd );
    error = BVD_PUSH_ENTRY( &my_bvd, number0, my_bvdf );
    error |= BVD_PUSH_ENTRY( &my_bvd, number1, my_bvdf );
    error |= BVD_PUSH_ENTRY( &my_bvd, number2, my_bvdf );
    if ( error != GM_OK )
        // there was not enough capacity to store 3 numbers in the given format
\endverbatim

To read this sequence again use:~
\verbatim
    BVD_INIT_SEQ_READ( &my_bvd );
    number0 = BVD_READ_NEXT_ENTRY( &my_bvd, my_bvdf );
    number1 = BVD_READ_NEXT_ENTRY( &my_bvd, my_bvdf );
    number2 = BVD_READ_NEXT_ENTRY( &my_bvd, my_bvdf );
    if ( number2 == NO_BLOCKVECTOR )
        // there were stored less than 3 numbers

/*D
BV_DESC_FORMAT - Data type for defining the storage pattern used in BV_DESC

STRUCTURES:
\verbatim
struct blockvector_description_format
{
    INT bits;                                       // bits per blocknumberentry
    BLOCKLEVEL max_level;                           // max. number of entries
    BVD_ENTRY_TYPE level_mask[BVD_MAX_ENTRIES];     // see below
    BVD_ENTRY_TYPE neg_digit_mask[BVD_MAX_ENTRIES]; // see below
};

typedef struct blockvector_description_format BV_DESC_FORMAT;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

As in the description of BV_DESC explained a sequence of BLOCKNUMBERs
is stored bitwise in BV_DESC. For each number a certain number of bits
is reserved forming one "packet". This "packets" are stored consecutively
in the memory.

Every function working with a BV_DESC needs the corresponding
BV_DESC_FORMAT to interpret the memory correctly. Be sure to use for
a certain BV_DESC always the same format; otherwise the consistency
of the data will be corrupted. Sure, it would be more safe to store
the format with the BV_DESC together, but the memory demand would be too
big.

The following variables are used to manage the handling of the "packets".
They are used internally by BV_DESC, a user has not to care about them.

. bits - The number of bits to be used for each blocknumber entry.

. max_level - The maximum number of entries that can be stored. This quantity
depends on the constant BVD_MAX_ENTRIES defined with BV_DESC.

. level_mask - This array contains the masks to isolate the entry for
a certain level; count 0..max_level-1.

. neg_digit_mask - This array contains the masks to clear the entry for
a certain level; count 0..max_level-1. This masks are the precomputed
complements of level_mask.

PREDEFINED VARIABLES:

Often used formats are predefined. You can give their adresses directly to
the called function working with a BV_DESC without any initialization.

.  DH_bvdf  - Useful for domain halfening methods (up to 4 blocks per level).

.  one_level_bvdf - Maximum number of blocks in a level but only 1 level.

EXAMPLES:

If your desires are fulfilled by one of the predefined variables, simple use
it. For example if you want to have only one blockvector level (e.g. for
stripewise domain decomposition) use one_level_bvdf for setting up a
BV_DESC:~
\verbatim
    BV_DESC my_bvd;

    BVD_INIT( &my_bvd );
    if ( BVD_PUSH_ENTRY( &my_bvd, blocknumber, &one_level_bvdf ) != GM_OK )
        // unexpected error; one number can always be stored.
    // work on with my_bvd
\endverbatim

To create a customized format use InitBVDF. For example to create
a format for managing a octree-like structure (that is subdividing a
3D cube into 8 subcubes) you can use the following command:~
\verbatim
   BV_DESC_FORMAT my_bvdf;

   InitBVDF( &my_bvdf, 8 );
\endverbatim

/*! \struct multigrid
 * \brief Data type representing a complete multigrid structure


Data type providing access to all information about the complete
multigrid hierarchy, problem description and memory management information.
This is the root of all.

. v - The MULTIGRID is an environment item, i.e. it resides in the environment
tree. v stores also the name of the MULTIGRID as it is declared in the new
and open commands.

. vertIdCounter,nodeIdCounter,elemIdCounter - Counters used to assign unique
identification numbers to VERTEX, NODE and ELEMENT objects. The counter
wraps around after 2 to the power of 32 objects have been allocated!

. topLevel - Finest grid level currently allocated in the MULTIGRID.

. currentLevel - Any number between 0 and topLevel. The currentLevel
is used by many commands that work on a grid level as default value. It can
be changed with the level command from the UG shell. 

. theDomain - Pointer to a DOMAIN structure that is to be used for the
mesh described by the MULTIGRID.

. theFormat - Pointer to a FORMAT structure describing all parameters
of the UG data structure that can be selected at run-time.  Especially
there are a lot of user definable data spaces in the basic objects.

. theProblem - Pointer to a PROBLEM structure giving access to the
user defined coefficient functions and boundary conditions that are
appropriate for the selected problem class.

. numOfSegments - Number of BNDSEGDESC structures accessible in the segments
array. This corresponds to the number of boundary segments in theDomain.

. numOfSegments - Number of subdomains, used for the grid generator.

. segments - Array of BNDSEGDESC structures. Index `i` in that array corresponds
to boundary segment `i`.

. corners - Array of pointers to VERTEX structures that are allocated at the
`corners` of theDomain. 

. numOfCorners - Number of corners of theDomain. This is also the size of the
corners array.

. theHeap - Pointer to a HEAP structure allocated for that MULTIGRID. The size
of this heap is selected with the open or new commands.

. grids - Array of pointers to GRID structures representing the individual
levels of the multigrid hierarchy.

. freeObjects - List of free objects sorted by object number. Memory management in
UG is such that new memory for an object is only allocated when no free object of the requested type
is available. If an object is no longer needed (e.g. when coarsening a mesh) it is
inserted in the appropriate list of free objects.

. freeVectors,freeConnections - List of free VECTOR and CONNECTION
objects sorted by type. Same comment as for freeObjects applies.

. Selection - Array of pointers to selection objects (VECTORs, NODEs or ELEMENTs)
that have been selected with the mouse in the graphical user interface or by the select command.

. NbOfSelections - Number of objects in the selection buffer (Selection).

. SelectionMode - Indicates type of objects in the selection buffer. Currently
nodeSelection, elementSelection and vectorSelection is possible.

. GenData - Management of general user data space in multigrid. At initialisation time
different modules can (pre)allocate storage which will (actually) be allocated in
each multigrid when it is opened. Storage is allocated and addressed by calls of
DefineMGUDBlock and GetMGUDBlockDescriptor resp. See also the macros below.
