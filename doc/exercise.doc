exercise - exercises for UG

INTRODUCTION:

Here are a number of exercises which can be done independently.


EXERCISE 1:

Type 

.vb
ugman ugdemo
.ve

and get familiar with the examples and the scripts.
Use the man pages to learn about the availible num procs and
the configuration.

EXERCISE 2:

Take one of the demo scripts and try 

.vb
ugrun <demo> <proc>
.ve

for various number of processors.
Find optimal parameters in the num proc configuration
depending on the number of processors.
Make a table of your results with
configuration (smooth, basesolver, number of pre- and
postsmoothing steps), number of iteration steps, solution time
depending on the problem size and number of processors ...

EXERCISE 3:

Take one of the time dependent demo scripts and 
make a meta film (see gpd.scr for an example).
Therefore, choose a finer grid and smaller time steps.
Then, let the script run over night.
The film can be displayed by 'xugv'.

EXERCISE 4:

Try all discretizations in fe/appl/simple.scr and find 
a method to determine optimal configurations
for all cases and different number of processors.

EXERCISE 5:

Type 

.vb
ugman simple
.ve

and work through the exercises given there.

EXERCISE 6:

Copy the LMGC num proc in ug/np/procs/iter.c and change
the order of the function call from multiplicative to
additive multigrid. Change the communication calls 
to larger interfaces and compare both methods.

For testing, change to an application directory and type

.vb
ugmake procs
make
ugrun <appl> <procs>
.ve

EXERCISE 7:

Copy the BCGS num proc in ug/np/procs/ls.c and change
it to GMRES. Therefore, take an orthogonalization
similar to 'Orthogonalize' in 'ew.c' and use the tools in
block.c for the solution of the small system.
Include the necessary parallel comunication tools
and check for all vectors, if they are consistent or inconsistent.

For testing, change to an application directory and type

.vb
ugmake procs
make
ugrun <appl> <procs>
.ve

EXERCISE 8:

Make a list of UG features, seperately for the tools in the
UG - library and for the special applications.
