/*D
   modules - survey of the structure of the ug software
   
OVERVIEW:
   Basically the UG source code is divided into three parts. The problem-
   independent `ug library`, the `problem class libraries`, that implement
   discretization, solvers, error estimators for a specific partial
   differential equation and the `applications` that use all these libraries
   to construct an executable. A problem class library together with its
   applications is called an `experimental environment` in some places
   of this manual.
   
UG KERNEL:
   The problem-independent part of ug (the ug kernel) is itself structured
   into several layers. These layers correspond directly to the subdirectories
   of the 'ug31/ug' directory. From top to bottom (high level to low level)
   these layers are explained in the following list.

.   'configuring~information~(config)' - Contains configuration files that parametrize
    the ug library to be build. These files are processed by the makefiles.

.   'user~interface~(ui)' -
	The core of 'ui' is a command interpreter which provides a script language and gives access to 
	commands of your application. This allows to type in all commands directly into the command line
	interface furthermore it is possible to gather a series of commands and control statements of the script
	language in a separate file. This script file can then be executed as one unity.
    The 'ui' layer also provides the graphical user interface with the help of the 'graph' and 'dev' layers.

.   'graphics~(graph)' -
	This module of `ug` realizes a small 2/3D color graphics model. Some features are scalar or vector plots 
	with arbitrary viewpoint and cutplanes on the viewed domain, solution or grid.

.   'numerical~procedures~(numerics)' - This layer provides ready to use linear algebra 
    routines and iterative methods (such as multigrid) for standard applications.
	The numerical procedures is also a toolset for the construction of new solvers on very high language level.
	Since they are implemented as commands, it is possible to access them on the script or command line level.
	This allows a quick and easy formulation of your appropriate solver and rapid prototyping of new ideas.

.   'grid~generator~(gg)' - Contains an advancing front grid generator for triangular
    meshes.

.   'grid~management~(gm)' - The grid manager module performs all operations which manipulate the grid. It controls the creation 
	and deletion of new elements during refine and provides a well defined interface to the layers above.
	For more details see man page `gm`.

.   'devices~(dev)' -
	`devices` defines an abstract device interface with a fixed functionality. The drivers for different real 
	devices as X11 or the `ug` internal graphics meta format are implemented in separate modules. All access 
	to X11 is for example managed by the submodule `xif`.

.   'low~tasks~(low)' -
	This module handles low tasks as providing memory management, treating machine architecture and operation system 
	dependencies. 
  
EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT:
   An experimenting environment is a directory containing the code 
   belonging to the problem class and application layer of an ug application.
   This directory may be placed anywhere in the file system and does not have to
   in a special position relative to the 'ug' directory. The name of the directory is
   an abbreviation of the corresponding problemclass name (e.g. "'diff2d'"
   for diffusion equation in 2 dimensions).
   There usually are three subdirectories:~
   
.  pclib - The `p`roblem `c`lass `lib`rary ('pclib') realizes the 
   problem class layer. In this
   directory you can find functions for e.g. discretising, solving and estimating.
   There exists a makefile (with the name 'Makefile') to build the
   problem class library named "'lib'`problem_class_identifier`'LIBSUFFIX.a'", 
   where
   the LIBSUFFIX distinguishs between the variants relative to the dimension
   of the domain and the locations of data (for further explanations see the
   manual page `installation`). The documentation is contained in the 
   subdirectories 'doc' and 'man'.
   
.  appl -  The `appl`ication layer is realized in this directory. Here is a
   concrete experiment formulated covering the description of the 
   domain shape and
   the boundary conditions. Furthermore in this directory is the makefile
   (with name 'Makefile') to build the application with the name 
   "`problem_class_identifier`'a'", the application defaults file 'defaults' 
   (see manual page `defaults`) and the application helpfile(s) '*.help' 
   (see manual page `helpfile`). Include within the makefile the correct
   configuration file from '$UGROOT/configs/' (see manual page 
   `installation`) for building
   different versions of your experimenting environment, but to generate
   different versions of the ug library you must edit the file 
   '$UGROOT/ug.conf' respectively copy one of the predefined ones from 
   '$UGROOT/configs/'.
   To keep this directory in order it is 
   advisable to create subdirectories for scripts, pictures, grids etc. and
   to register these subdirectories in the 'defaults' file. The 
   documentation is contained in the subdirectories 'doc' and 'man'.
   Be sure to start an application always from this application 
   directory because
   some functions need the current directory to be an application directory.
   To make different experiments it is a favourable proceeding to maintain
   them in different application directories.

.  man - This directory contains subdirectories with the manual pages 
   supplied by this experimenting environment. See manual page `installation`
   for the correct installation of the manual pages. This pages you can not
   view with the 'ugman' command because of bugs in the UNIX 'man' command; use
   the 'xugman' command for this purpose.
     
   In the ug3 distribution are 4 experimenting environments included:~
   
.  cd3d - For solution of the scalar, stationary 
   convection-diffusion 
   equation in three dimensions with a Finite Volume scheme using 
   tetrahedron elements.
.  diff2d - For solution of the scalar 2 dimensional diffusion equation.
.  fem - For solution of 2 dimensional Lame and Laplace vector equations 
   with nonconforming P1-elements.
.  ns2d - For solution of the 2 dimensional stationary incompressible
   Navier Stokes equation with a Finite Volume scheme consistent 
   stabilized according to Schneider and Raw.

   defaults - file containig default settings for an executable application
   
   FILENAME:
   "'defaults'", stored in an application directory
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   The 'defaults' file contains some load time configurable parameters
   for an executable produced with the ug libraries. It must reside in
   the same directory where the application (the executable program)
   is stored.
   The man page `modules` contains an explanation of the directory
   structure of the ug software. For further configuration facilities refer
   to the manual pages `Installation` and `makefiles`.
   
   The entries in the defaults-file can be read from C-code with the
   function 'GetDefaultValue'. You can append your own entries to the
   defaults file and read them with this function. In the follwing the
   entries recognized by ug are listed.

   FILE FORMAT:
   Each line contains one setting in the form "`variable` `value`". 
   Lines with unrecognized variables do not trouble.
   
   VARIABLES RECOGNIZED BY UG:
.  envmemory -  environment memory in bytes
.  helpfiles -  list of help files ('*.help'). Give blank-separated 
      list, specifications relatively to the current working directory or

   helpfile - format of UGs online help manuals
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   UGs online help messages (see the command 'help')
   are contained in standard ASCII files that you can extend to your needs.
   A help file should have the extension '.help'.
   UG can process several help-files at a time. A list of all help files
   to be processed is defined in the defaults-file of the application (see
   manpage 'defaults'). In the following the format of a help file is
   explained and the names of the existing help files are listed.

   FILE FORMAT:
   '<helpfile> := { -[<helpitem> [ > {keyword }+ ]] <lines of ascii text> }*'
   
   The file consits of a sequence of entries. Each entry starts with a minus
   sign "'-'" in the first column and ends before the next minus sign in 
   the first column and, if that does not occur, at the end of the file.
   
   In each entry follows after the minus sign the '<helpitem>', that is the 
   word to be typed in the 'help' command. After the '<helpitem>' can follow
   separated by an "'>'" an optional list of keywords recognized by
   the 'help $k' command version. The rest of the entry is displayed as the
   answer to the 'help' command on the screen and can contain arbitrary
   lines of text, except a minus sign in the first column that marks the
   beginning of the next entry.
   
   Note: If an entry has no '<helpitem>' it acts as a comment in 
   the helpfile and does not affect any retrieval.
   
   DEPENDENCIES:
   All the helpfiles must be registered in the 'defaults'-file (see 
   above or manual page `defaults`).
   
   RELATED FILES:
.  $UGROOT/doc/ug.help general ug features 
.  '$UGROOT/doc/ug2d.help' - special ug features in 2 dimensions
.  '$UGROOT/doc/ug3d.help' - special ug features in 3 dimensions
.  `experimenting_environment`'/appl/*.help' - application specific topics
