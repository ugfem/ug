HOWTO for UG
============

Purpose:
	- explain gory practical or conceptual details when using UG 
	- with growing contents it should be a helpful
	  and time saving database

Structure:
	- explanations are structured in a module by module 
	  manner

Usage:
	- grep this HOWTO via keywords or 
    - try to find a section of interest concerning with
	  the problem you have

Extensions:
	- evereyone using UG is welcome to contribute
	- please document all problems, also these which seem
	  to be "easy" or clear after you solved them.
	  Our mind is a subtile thing.

Mantainance:
	- should get a small rework of its structure and
	  content every few month(?)


General:

Which sources of information exist about UG?
- UG homepage: http://cox.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~ug
- ug tutorial
- inline documentation in commands.c about ug script commands.


UG/ug/graphics/uggraph:
----------------------

Vector plotobject:

-	How can I change the size of vectors?

	Use "setplotobject EVector $c 0 $t 0.1 $l <n>", 
	where $c 0 indicated no cutting of vectors,
	$l <n> is the cutlengthfactor between [0.1,10].  
	Additionally use "findrange $z <f>"  <f> in [0.1,0.25]
	to scale the values.
	See also UG/ug/graphics/uggraph/wpm.c: EVector2D,EVector3D

UG/ug/tools:
-----------

ugpfm: 

ugpfm is for merging parallel datafiles/directories into their
sequential counterpart.
To read in the sequential file(s) increase the heap size in the
loaddata command with the $h option, since the file(s) contain
the heap size allocated by a single of the former parallel 
processes. This heap size is in most cases to small for the
big sequential multigrid of the merged file(s) and the resulting 
error gives no hint towards increasing the heap size.


UG/ug/gm:
--------

Q: How to use periodic boundary conditions with UG?

A: To compile UG set in file UG/ug/gm/gm.h the define
	#define __PERIODIC_BOUNDARY__
Then fully (re)compile UG.
To define periodic boundaries write an application function
	PeriodicBoundaryInfoProcPtr PBI
for its prototype see gm.h.
This function must be provided to UG via a call to
	INT SetPeriodicBoundaryInfoProcPtr (PeriodicBoundaryInfoProcPtr PBI);
When you have readin/constructed the coarse grid. One script call to
the command 
	makeperiodic
will modify the grid appropriately. From this point on all 
functionality (adaption, solution) work transparently (without any
further effort) in periodic mode.

An example of periodidc usage is in course/appl/couplex2/couplex2.c
the function 
	Couplex2_PeriodicBoundaryInfo.
In script file course/appl/couplex2/couplex2.scr you can see when
"makeperiodic" is called. The SetPeriodicBoundaryInfoProcPtr call is
done in the separate application command "setperiodic".



UG/ug/np:
--------

Q: How to compile UG/ug/np with large format to compute large coupled
   systems?

A: 
The following text describes how to make UG to accept up to 180 components
in every vector descriptor. Be aware that this has not been completely tested
yet. Use it on your own risk!

1. In 'ug/gm/gm.h', set MSIZEMAX to 4294967295U in the '#else' section of
   '#ifndef __XXL_MSIZE__'. (The old value is 10000000.)

2. Redefine 'SHORT' from 'short' to 'int' for all the architectures in
   'ug/arch/compiler.h'. (DEC, LINUXAXP, LINUXIA64, NECSX4, SR2201 - Can
   'int' be too short? - INT is defined to be 'long'.)

3. You may reset 'MAX_SUB' in 'ug/np/udm/formats.h'. The default value is
   12. This macro should determine the maximal number of subcomponents
   declared in the 'format' command. We set it now to 180.

4. Redefine A_REASONABLE_NUMBER in 'ug/np/udm/udm.c' from 100 to 180.
   (A better way would be perhaps to delete lines 2656-2657 in this file
   - the only lines where this macro occures. These contain merely
   ASSERT's and do not influence the functionality of the code principally.)

5. In 'ug/np/udm/udm.h', make the following changes:
   a) set MAX_SINGLE_VEC_COMP and MAX_VEC_COMP to 180. (The old value is 40.)
   b) set MAX_SINGLE_MAT_COMP to 32400 (= 180 * 180). (The old value is 1600 =
      40 * 40.)
   c) set MAX_MAT_COMP and MAX_MAT_COMP_TOTAL to 64800 (= 2 * 180 * 180).
      (The old value is 7000.)
   There can be conflicts with the default names of components (cf.
   DEFAULT_NAMES in this file), but they should not lead to problems.

6. Note that there are only sizeof (INT) * 8 skip flags in UG. This make no
   problem for the sequential computations. For the parallel computations,
   there are two possibilities: a) All your skip flags are equal, or
   b) Define the macro _XXL_SKIPFLAGS_ in 'ug/np/algebra/ugblas.c'. In the
   latter case, the skip flag with index (sizeof (INT) * 8 - 1) is used
   for all components with indices >= (sizeof (INT) * 8 - 1).


UG/ug/ui:
--------

Q: How to save and load data without saving and loading the multigrid?

A: Saving data without the multigrid is done by using the option '$p' in the
   savedata-command ('p' for save pure data). Example:
        savedata test $t xdr $a sol $p;
   Loading the data without the multigrid can be done by adding the option
   '$r' in the loaddata-command ('r' for read only data). Example:
        loaddata test $t xdr $a sol $r;


UG/ug/dom/lgm:
-------------

Q: How is the left/right subdomain information of 3d-lgm surface defined?

A: The right hand rule applies in the following way: Consider
  the nodes of the first triangle. If you follow the rotation direction
  of nodes 0, 1 and 2 the thumb of your right hand points into the 
  left subdomain. 


UG/ug/arch:
--------

Q: Why does my newly compiled UG application fail during load migration
	with an error signal?

A: Compile again.  Do a "module switch cc cc.3.3.0.1" before recompilation!
	The new cray compiler has an unfixed bug.
