				HOWTO go parallel using UG
				==========================

CAUTION: these steps are only a descrition for 
		 ugcore internal use, and fit to a setup

PURPOSE:

Short description what is to do, when you want to run 
your application with a parallel UG version. 

STEPS:

The following steps are nescessary.

1. Configure UG
2. Compile UG
3. Link your application
4. Start your application
5. Modify your scripts


1. Configure UG

First you need to do the basic UG configuration. This means
you should know what parallel model you want to use and
select this  model using the command 'ugconf'.

The parallel model depends mainly on the hardware,
you choose. This is one of  
	Model			Platform
	-----			--------
	PVM				workstation clusters, 
					many supercomputers 
	MPI				workstations clusters,
					many supercomputers 
	SHMEMT3D		Cray T3D (shmem)
	SHMEM           ????????
	NX				Intel Paragon (nx)
	NXLIB			workstation clusters (simulating nx)
	PARIX			Parsytec computers:
					Supercluster, CC
	SEQ				serial version (default)

for a full list of currently supported models type 
'ugconf -help'.

For Models PVM or MPI you need to set the environment
variable PVM_ROOT (PVM) or MPIHOME (MPI) and uncomment
the following lines in ug.conf to set the model dependent include and
library information correctly:

for PVM:
	in the shell ressource file (~/.tcshrc):
		setenv PVM_ROOT /rlocal/pvm3
		setenv PVM_ARCH HPPA
		setenv PVM_DEBUGGER /usr/softbench/bin/softdebug
		setenv MANPATH "${MANPATH}:/rlocal/pvm3/man"

	in ug/ug.conf:
		MODEL_ENV_CFLAGS = -I$(PVM_ROOT)/include
		MODEL_ENV_LFLAGS = -L$(PVM_ROOT)/lib/$(PVM_ARCH) -lpvm3
		
	in ~/hosts
		* ep=/home/christian/ug/UG/simple wd=/home/christian/ug/UG/simple
		#first line should be machine you start the pvmd
		piz
	
	in ~/.pvmrc
		setenv PVM_EXPORT "->"

	anywhere in your path:
		pvmd3		(e.g. from /rlocal/pvm3/lib/HPPA)
		
for MPI (not recommended on HP):
	in the shell ressource file (~/.tcshrc):
		setenv MPIHOME /home/birken/birken/sw/mpi/mpich
		set path=($path $MPIHOME/bin)

	in ug/ug.conf:
		MODEL_ENV_CFLAGS = -I$(MPIHOME)/include
		MODEL_ENV_LFLAGS = -L$(MPIHOME)/lib/IRIX/ch_p4 -lmpi

Set other configuration options, you want using 'ugconf'.
All but GRAPE should work with parallel models.


2. Compile UG

Now compile UG in the usual way, all parallel stuff like
ddd, ppif, dddif should be compiled transparently.
After successfull compilation the $UGROOT/lib directory
contains beside your parallel UG library 'libug2/3.a' 
the additional parallel libs 'libddd.a', 'libppif.a'.


3. compile/link your application

To compile/link your application modify your
applicaton's Makefile
according to the Makefile of a UG application like
$UGROOT/../simple or other.

Ensure that it contains the line

	include $(UGROOT)/ug.conf

at the beginning. With this include all necessary options
are passed into your Makefile.
The target for compilation should look like

.c.o:
	$(ARCH_CC) $(UG_CFLAGS) $<

the link target should look similar to

simple:
	$(UG_LINK) -o simple $(OBJECTS) $(UG_LIBS) $(UG_LFLAGS)

Remember that an action line (e.g. $(ARCH_CC) $(UG_CFLAGS) $<)
must have a <tab> at the beginning.


4. Start parallel application

If you succeded in the last steps, you should now have your
application as an executable file.

For PVM check that you have a ~/hosts file containing the line:

* ep=/home/stefan/UG/fem/appl wd=/home/stefan/UG/fem/appl

at the beginning. Now change to the directory where your
application resides and start the pvm daemon using the command:
	'ugpvmcontext $PWD'
this command will modify the ~/hosts/file and restart the
pvm daemon.
'ugpvmcontext' will only work correctly, if
'pvmd3' is accessible by your shell (PATH variable).
You can find 'pvmd3' in /rlocal/pvm3/lib/<arch>, where
<arch> is the architecture (e.g. HPPA).

Starting the application is now really easy. 
Use the command 'ugrun <appl> <procs>', e.g. if you want
to start the application 'simple' on 2 processors, enter:

	ugrun simple 2


5. Modify your scripts

A script should contain the command
	'context $a'
so that following skript commands are executed on
all processors.

After coarse grid completion you should insert
the command 'fixcoarsegrid', which 
does a distribution of the coarse grid to all
processors.

Now hopefully all works and you have fun with 
your parallel UG version.
